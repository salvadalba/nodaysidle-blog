Last year I decided to build my own home server. As an IT professional I wanted to have my little “lab” at home to try new technologies and to host some services for personal use. I’ve been using it for a while now and I’m pretty happy with it.

I decided to go with a small form factor case, a mini-ITX motherboard and a low power CPU. I wanted to have a machine that is on 24/7 without consuming too much power and without making too much noise.
