title: My NAS Build
---

I decided to build a NAS from scratch. The main reason is that I don't trust any third party cloud for my personal data, another one is I wanted to have some fun doing it and the last but not least I wanted to learn how to do it. A NAS is a Network Attached Storage, a device that is connected to your network and allows you to store and retrieve data from a centralized location.

### The Hardware

I wanted to build a small, low power consumption and quiet NAS. I decided to go with a mini-ITX form factor. I choose the following components:

*   **Case:** Fractal Design Node 304
*   **Motherboard:** ASRock J4105-ITX
*   **RAM:** 8GB DDR4 Crucial
*   **Storage:** 2x 4TB Western Digital Red
*   **PSU:** be quiet! SFX POWER 2 300W

### The Operating System

I decided to go with FreeNAS. It is a free and open-source operating system based on FreeBSD that is designed to be used as a NAS. The main feature I was interested in was ZFS, a combined file system and logical volume manager.
